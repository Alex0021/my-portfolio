I’m a naturally curious and hands-on engineer who enjoys understanding how complex systems work as a whole. Learning is part of my everyday routine — whether it’s exploring new tools, debugging tricky problems, or experimenting with side projects. People around me often describe me as organized, reliable, and open-minded, and I try to bring that mindset into both teamwork and independent work. I also value balance: helping others, staying active, and keeping a healthy rhythm are just as important as technical growth.

I gravitated toward robotics because it matches both my generalist mindset and my belief that technology should ultimately serve people. I’m especially drawn to systems where humans and robots collaborate, since thoughtful interaction can significantly improve performance in real-world tasks. Drone swarms capture that excitement perfectly — they’re fun and inherently fascinating, but also powerful tools for exploration, search-and-rescue, surveillance, and large-scale deployment. What keeps me motivated is that robotics always comes back to strong fundamentals while leaving endless room for experimentation and innovation. Working through that balance — theory, integration, and real-world impact — is what pushes me to keep learning and improving.

## Overview

<div style="display:flex; gap:50px; justify-content:center;">
<p>
<br><br>
This thesis explores how aerial swarm control interfaces can adapt in real time to a pilot’s cognitive state. Instead of treating swarm control as a fixed interaction, the system dynamically adjusts swarm behavior based on estimated stress and cognitive load.
<br><br>
The goal is to reduce operator overload while keeping the pilot engaged — supporting safe and efficient human-in-the-loop swarm operation.

## Problem

Controlling an aerial swarm introduces high cognitive demand due to the number of agents and system degrees of freedom. This workload varies with task complexity and pilot experience.

Excessive demand can lead to overload, while insufficient challenge reduces engagement. Both conditions degrade performance in human-supervised robotics.

Current swarm interfaces rarely account for the pilot’s cognitive state, leaving adaptation entirely manual.

## What Is Novel

This work investigates **user-adaptive swarm control**, where swarm behavior responds to real-time estimates of pilot cognitive load.

Key innovations include:

- Eye-tracking-based cognitive state estimation  
- Dynamic mapping between user state and swarm behavior  
- Maintaining operator engagement and responsiveness  
- Human-centered adaptation within swarm autonomy  

Rather than optimizing only robot performance, the system explicitly optimizes the **human–swarm interaction loop**.

## Approach

### Cognitive state estimation

High-frequency eye tracking is used to infer indicators of **cognitive load**.

### Adaptive swarm interface

A Unity-based simulation environment enables rapid testing of different scenarios.

### Validation pipeline

The system will be evaluated through controlled user studies measuring:

- Task performance  
- Cognitive load metrics  
- Engagement stability  

A hardware validation phase with DJI drones is planned to test transfer beyond simulation.

## Current Status

- Literature review completed  
- Cognitive load estimation pipeline under development  
- Unity swarm simulation environment in progress

## Expected Impact

This work explores how adaptive autonomy can improve human performance in complex robotic systems. The framework may inform future swarm interfaces that actively support operator decision-making instead of passively executing commands.
